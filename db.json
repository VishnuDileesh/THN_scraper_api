have discovered critical vulnerabilities in industrial VPN implementations primarily used to provide remote access to operational technology (OT) networks that could allow hackers to overwrite data, execute malicious code, and compromise industrial control systems (ICS).A new report published by industrial cybersecurity company Claroty demonstrates multiple severe vulnerabilities in enterprise-grade VPN installations, including Secomea GateManager M2M Server, Moxa EDR-G902, and EDR-G903, and HMS Networks eWon's eCatcher VPN client.These vulnerable products are widely used in field-based industries such as oil and gas, water utilities, and electric utilities to remotely access, maintain and monitor ICS and field devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and input/output devices.According to Claroty researchers, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can give an unauthenticated attacker direct access to the ICS devices and potentially cause some physical damage.In Secomean's GateManager, researchers uncovered multiple security flaws, including a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-14500) that allows overwriting arbitrary data, executing arbitrary code, or causing a DoS condition, running commands as root, and obtaining user passwords due to the use of a weak hash type.GateManager is a widely used ICS remote access server deployed worldwide as a cloud-based SaaS solution that allows users to connect to the internal network from the internet through an encrypted tunnel while avoiding server setups.The critical flaw, identified as CVE-2020-14500, affects the GateManager component, the main routing instance in the Secomea remote access solution.\nThe flaw occurs due to improper handling of some of the HTTP request headers provided by the client.This flaw can be exploited remotely and without requiring any authentication to achieve remote code execution, which could result in gaining full access to a customer's internal network, along with the ability to decrypt all traffic that passes through the VPN.In Moxa EDR-G902 and EDR-G903 industrial VPN servers, researchers discovered a stack-based buffer overflow bug (CVE-2020-14511) in the system web server that can be triggered just by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, eventually allowing attackers to carry out remote code execution without the need for any credentials.Claroty researchers also tested HMS Networks' eCatcher, a proprietary VPN client that connects to the company's eWon VPN device, and found that the product is vulnerable to a critical stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14498) that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.All an attacker needs to do is tricking victims into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious email containing a specifically crafted HTML element that triggers the flaw in eCatcher, eventually allowing attackers to take complete control of the targeted machine.All three vendors were notified of the vulnerabilities and responded quickly to release security fixes that patch their products' loopholes.Secomea users are recommended to update their products to the newly released GateManager versions 9.2c / 9.2i, Moxa users need to update EDR-G902/3 to version v5.5 by applying firmware updates available for the EDR-G902 series and EDR-G903 series , and HMS Networks users are

servers deployed in data centers and cloud environments.The vulnerabilities were identified by F-Secure researchers earlier this March and disclosed on Thursday, a day after SaltStack released a patch (version 3000.2) addressing the issues , rated with CVSS score 10.\n\"The researchers warned that the flaws could be exploited in the wild imminently.\nAdditionally, the master uses two ZeroMQ channels, a \"request server\" to which minions report the execution results and a \"publish server,\" where the master publishes messages that the minions can connect and subscribe to.According to F-Secure researchers, the pair of flaws reside within the tool's ZeroMQ protocol.\n\"The impact is full remote command execution as root on both the master and all minions that connect to it.\n\"Exploitation of the authentication vulnerabilities will result in the ASCII strings \"_prep_auth_info\" or \"_send_pub\" appearing in data sent to the request server port (default 4506),\" it added.It's highly recommended that Salt users update the software packages to the latest version."}, "51": {"title": "CISA Warns Patched Pulse Secure VPNs Could Still Expose Organizations to Hackers",

Servers Become Lucrative TargetThe United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) yesterday issued a fresh advisory alerting organizations to change all their Active Directory credentials as a defense against cyberattacks trying to leverage a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN servers\u2014even if they have already patched it.The warning comes three months after another CISA alert urging users and administrators to patch Pulse Secure VPN environments to thwart attacks exploiting the vulnerability.\n\"Threat actors who successfully exploited CVE-2019-11510 and stole a victim organization's credentials will still be able to access \u2014 and move laterally through \u2014 that organization's network after the organization has patched this vulnerability if the organization did not change those stolen credentials,\" CISA said.CISA has also released a tool to help network administrators look for any indicators of compromise associated with the flaw.Tracked as CVE-2019-11510 , the pre-authentication arbitrary file read vulnerability could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to compromise vulnerable VPN servers and gain access to all active users and their plain-text credentials, and execute arbitrary commands.The flaw stems from the fact that directory traversal is hard-coded to be allowed if a path contains \"dana/html5/acc,\" thus allowing an attacker to send specially crafted URLs to read sensitive files, such as \"/etc/passwd\" that contains information about each user on the system.To address this issue, Pulse Secure released an out-of-band patch on April 24, 2019.While on August 24, 2019, security intelligence firm Bad Packets was able to discover 14,528 unpatched Pulse Secure servers, a subsequent scan as of last month yielded 2,099 vulnerable endpoints , indicating that a vast majority of organizations have patched their VPN gateways.The fact that there are still over thousands of unpatched Pulse Secure VPN servers has made them a lucrative target for bad actors to distribute malware.A report from ClearSky found Iranian state-sponsored hackers using CVE-2019-11510 , among others, to penetrate and steal information from target IT and telecommunication companies across the world.According to an NSA advisory from October 2019, the \"exploit code is freely available online via the Metasploit framework, as well as GitHub.\nMalicious cyber actors are actively using this exploit code.\n\"In a similar alert issued last year, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) warned that advanced threat groups are exploiting the vulnerability to target government, military, academic, business, and healthcare organizations.More recently, Travelex , the foreign currency exchange and travel insurance firm, became a victim after cybercriminals planted Sodinokibi (REvil) ransomware on the company's networks via the Pulse Secure vulnerability.\nAlthough the ransomware operators demanded a ransom of $6 million (\u00a34.6 million), a Wall Street Journal report last week said it paid $2.3 million in the form of 285 Bitcoin to resolve its problem.In the face of ongoing attacks, it's recommended that organizations upgrade their Pulse Secure VPN, reset their credentials, and scan for unauthenticated log requests and exploit attempts.CISA has also suggested removing any unapproved remote access programs and inspecting scheduled tasks for scripts or executables that may allow an attacker to connect to an environment.For more steps to mitigate the flaw, head to

that integrity in Linux based software installation mechanisms rely on digitally signing files while downloading files over the insecure HTTP connection.Besides this, to exploit the vulnerability, attackers also need to serve a malicious package with the size equals to that specified in the package list on downloads.openwrt.org.According to the project team, OpenWrt versions 18.06.0 to 18.06.6 and 19.07.0, as well as LEDE 17.01.0 to 17.01.7, are affected.To fix this issue, affected users are advised to upgrade their device firmware to the latest OpenWrt versions 18.06.7 and 19.07.1, which were released last month."}, "53": {"title": "US Government Warns of a New Strain of Chinese 'Taidoor' Virus", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2020/08/chinese-hacking-malware.html", "categoryname":

\"massive global surveillance campaign\" targeting oil and gas, finance, and healthcare sectors.Awake Security, which disclosed the findings late last week, said the malicious browser add-ons were tied back to a single internet domain registrar, GalComm.However, it's not immediately clear who is behind the spyware effort.\n\"This campaign and the Chrome extensions involved performed operations such as taking screenshots of the victim device, loading malware, reading the clipboard, and actively harvesting tokens and user input,\" Awake Security said.The extensions in question posed as utilities offering capabilities to convert files from one format to the other, among other tools for secure browsing, while relying on thousands of fake reviews to trick unsuspecting users into installing them.Furthermore, the actors behind the operation leveraged evasion techniques to avoid flagging the domains as malicious by anti-malware solutions, thereby allowing the surveillance campaign to go undetected.In total, the extensions were downloaded nearly 33 million times over the course of three months before Awake Security reached out to Google in May.The search giant, in response to the disclosures, has deactivated the problematic browser extensions.\nThe full list of offending extension IDs can be accessed here Telemetry data has revealed that some of these extensions were active on the networks of \"financial services, oil and gas, media and entertainment, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, retail, high-tech, higher education, and government organizations,\" although there's no evidence that they were actually used to collect sensitive data.\n\"Galcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,\" the Israel-based registrar's owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters, which broke the development.Deceptive extensions on the Chrome Web Store have continued to be a problem, what with bad actors exploiting it for malvertising and other data-stealing campaigns.Earlier this February, Google removed 500 malware-ridden extensions after they were caught serving adware and sending users' browsing activity to attacker-controlled servers.\nThen in April, the company yanked another set of 49 extensions that masqueraded as cryptocurrency wallets to steal Keystore information.It's recommended that users review extension permissions by visiting \"chrome://extensions\" on the Chrome browser, consider uninstalling those that are rarely used, or switch to other software alternatives that don't require invasive access to browser activity."}, "55": {"title": "Hackers Target Military and Aerospace Staff by Posing as HRs Offering Jobs", "link":
